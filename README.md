Solution of the Schodinger Eqation for Harmonic Oscillator Confined in Potential well (Dirichlet's Condition on both boundaries). 

- Shifted Inverse Power routine is used to find eigen values
- Tridiagonal Optimized
- Trapezoid integration is used to normalize wavefunctions.
- Benchmark using Scipy.special.Hermit Polynomials.


v3.0
-------------------

- To implement tracking eigen values in the shifted power routine for better visual aesthetic.

DONE - 

- Gif created for visualising the confinement
- Optimised (Vectorization in solver.py)
- Tridiagonal optimisation completed
- Normalized the eigen state using trapezium integration
- Added Hermite poly for comparison.

=====================================

v2.1
